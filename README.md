### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

A very catchy and apt project for the Nigerian Dec 2022 political season.    
Didn't quite use an API to fetch the random; hosted it directly via Objects.  
But learning about APIs is next on my ToDo list.
